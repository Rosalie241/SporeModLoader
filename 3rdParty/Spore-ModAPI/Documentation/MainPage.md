The <b>Spore %ModAPI SDK</b> allows you to create C++ mods for Spore. These mods are compiled into <tt>.dll</tt> files,
that can then be used by the <b>[%ModAPI Launcher Kit](http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/ModAPI/Public/index.html)</b> to inject them into Spore.

Instructions about download, installation and updating can be found [in this tutorial](_installation.html).

The source code can be found at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/emd4600/Spore-ModAPI). It also includes the source code
of 3 real mods made with the %ModAPI SDK:
 - [EnhancedColorPicker](https://github.com/emd4600/Spore-ModAPI/tree/master/Projects/Example%20Projects/EnhancedColorPicker)
 - [GmdlExport](https://github.com/emd4600/Spore-ModAPI/tree/master/Projects/Example%20Projects/GmdlExport)
 - [ModCreatorKit](https://github.com/emd4600/Spore-ModAPI/tree/master/Projects/Example%20Projects/ModCreatorKit)
